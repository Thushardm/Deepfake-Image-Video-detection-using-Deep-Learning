# Deep Learning for Media Authentication and Fake Content Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

With the rise of deepfakes and AI-manipulated media, verifying the authenticity of digital content has become a critical issue across social media, journalism, security, and forensics. This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect forged images and videos—including deepfakes, splicing, and AI-generated media—to safeguard digital integrity and build public trust.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automatically detect fake or manipulated media content.
- Handle multiple forgery types: deepfakes, copy-move, splicing, etc.
- Build a lightweight, real-time, and explainable detection system.
- Maintain scalability for high-volume content analysis.
- Support multiple formats: `.jpg`, `.mp4`, `.mp3`, `.txt`, etc.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Languages & IDEs:** Python, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** 
  - TensorFlow & Keras (for CNNs, RNNs, GANs)
  - Scikit-learn, OpenCV
  - NLTK, SpaCy (for NLP/text-based forgery detection)
- **Tools:** Anaconda Navigator, GitHub, Excel
- **Visualization:** TensorBoard, Matplotlib
- **Deployment Tools:** Chrome (UI Testing), GitHub (Version Control)

## 📦 System Features

- Upload & analyze media (image/video).
- Detect anomalies using trained deep learning models.
- Classify media as authentic or fake with explainability cues.
- Real-time inference and feedback.
- Scalable, privacy-aware architecture.

## 🧩 Model Architectures

- **Image Detection:** CNNs, VGG-16, ResNet, Autoencoders
- **Video Detection:** RNNs, BiLSTM, ConvLSTM, Transformers
- **Advanced Architectures:** Vision Transformers, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
